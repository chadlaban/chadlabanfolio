							<h2>An unexpected enjoyment for Software Development.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							I am an Information Technology graduate from Saint Louis University (Baguio City). I started my career in the software industry as a Software Analyst; 
							I enjoyed, improved, and learned a lot in how to handle people and how to compose myself at stressful situations because of this role, 
							little did I know that this was to set myself to step outside my shell. I saw an opportunity to start my Software Developer career on the same
							company and did not expect to get accepted on my 2nd try applying for the position.

							<br /><br />The first few weeks was a challenge when I started my software developer career, considering that I haven't done any coding practice ever 
							since I graduated from university. I even started to doubt myself because of the challenges, but knowing who I am, I still faced those challenges. As time
							passes and I got to work along with amazing developers this made my path more interesting and fun, which is something I did not expect on a corporate job.

							<br /><br />There are a lot of factors that ignited my passion for software development, but the biggest impact in my career so far to do better at this role was 
							actually the people I had the chance to work with.
						</p>
						<p id="expandable" hidden>
							I am a person who loves learning more from people and I'm someone who always strive to have quality outputs for work. I also appreciate
							working with teams and learning from them. Outside work, I'm someone who loves playing FPS and single player games. I also love cooking meals
							for myself and I also jog occasionally, and trying to start a hobby of reading books.
